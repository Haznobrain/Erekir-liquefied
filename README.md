# Welcome to erekir but we (me and my schizo imaginary friends) applied a shit ton of heat to it!
## I made this mod pretty much alone and the stuff that was made by others has credit given in its description or file.

My discord is either mindustridiot_06647 or haznobrainDev.

<br>the sprite quality may vary a lot.
## What does this add?
- a bunch of erekir maps
- a few erekir unit lines
- a bit of post-origin content
- a few turrets
- new materials

## A lot of the stuff in the mod will be changed sooner or later, especially maps.
so ye ig you should play, enjoy, and leave a star if you want :3
